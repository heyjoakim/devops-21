## Notes
We meet on mondays from 10.00 - X.X.X.X (Super agile here!!)

For next week we need to note everything we do!

### This is our branching strategy
PR
Develop -> Feature

Branch out from develop into a feature / bug and then create a pr to merge back into develop. From develop releases are pushed to production (maybe one test enviornment?).
